# vuejs-pinia

 A simple project where users are listed with detailed information using Vue 3 and Pinia.  An example of using state actions getters in Pinia. I performed actions fetch by keeping the data in the state and the sate update operation is also included in the getters.

 Pinia has a simpler API than Vuex and offers an easier to use and understand structure. Pinia doesn't have a mutations section. Pinia also has better TypeScript support than Vuex and is more closely compatible with the Vue Composition API.
